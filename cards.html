            Cards are the only method of deploying troops, spells, and buildings onto the battlefield. Deploying cards costs Elixir, which is gradually gained during battle.
            Cards are primarily obtained through buying them with Gold or Gems in the Shop, or through finding them in Chests. Cards can also be received through trading or through clan members fulfilling requests.
            Duplicate cards obtained will fill up an upgrade meter. Once the meter is full, you can upgrade the card with Gold. All health and damage statistics are increased by roughly 10% per level. Cards that are able to spawn troops,
            such as the Goblin Hut and Graveyard, will have their spawned troop level increased by 1 per level.There are three main types of cards: troops, spells, and buildings. Generally, spells are temporary and can be cast anywhere in the battlefield (with the exception of The Log, Barbarian Barrel, and Royal Delivery), while buildings (which are stationary and decay over time) and troops (which can move) can only be spawned on the player's territory (with the exception of the Miner and Goblin Drill)
