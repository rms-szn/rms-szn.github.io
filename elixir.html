            Elixir is used to play cards into the arena. The player begins a battle with 5 Elixir and can hold a maximum of 10 Elixir during a battle.
            Elixir is considered 'profited' when the player spends less Elixir than the opponent and thus the Elixir grows beyond the opponent's.
            Gaining an Elixir profit by making a play is known as a 'positive Elixir trade'. To gain Elixir, defend with cards that cost less than the opponent's attacking unit.
            Common examples are Skeleton Armies defending Giants and Arrows defending Minion Hordes. Both net a 2 Elixir profit.
            It is important for the player to not maximize on Elixir, as the player will be unable to generate any more as long as the bar is full. This is called "leaking" Elixir
            (when a player is at 10 Elixir and not spending it).

            **Elixir is just as important as other game mechanics like card placement and having a balanced deck.**
